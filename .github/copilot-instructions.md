Always use angular best practices and conventions when writing code for this project. Follow the Angular style guide and use Angular CLI for generating components, services, and other artifacts. Ensure that the code is modular, reusable, and maintainable. Use TypeScript features effectively, including interfaces and types, to enhance code quality and readability.
Avoid using inline styles and prefer Angular's built-in styling mechanisms. Use Angular's reactive forms for form handling and validation. Implement lazy loading for feature modules to optimize performance. Use Angular's dependency injection
Use standalone components and directives where appropriate to enhance modularity. Ensure that the code is well-documented, with clear comments explaining complex logic and component interactions. Use Angular's built-in testing utilities to write unit tests for components and services, ensuring high test coverage and reliability.
Use Angular's routing features to create a seamless navigation experience. Implement state management using services or libraries
